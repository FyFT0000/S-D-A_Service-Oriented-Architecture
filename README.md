# S-D-A_Service-Oriented-Architecture
Software Design and Architecture - Service Oriented Architecture


Based on an understanding of architectural styles, review architectures for web applications, explore the basics of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) in two approaches: Web Services (WS*) and Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture. 

The Capstone Project: connect a Java-based Android application with Elasticsearch, a web service with a REST application programmer interface (API).

Completing this,will be able to: 
• Describe SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) to structure web-based systems.
• Explain WS* services (i.e., SOAP over HTTP, WSDL, UDDI, BPEL).	
• Apply REST architecture (i.e., JSON over HTTP, URI).	
• Identify REST design principles.	
• Create a system using REST interfaces.	
• Apply microservice architecture.
